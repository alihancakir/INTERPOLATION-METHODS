Hello everyone,

Interpolation means an approximate estimation. 
Such equations are very important for engineering. 
For example, it can be considered a method to predict how much electricity a company will consume or how many products will be sold on a given day by using previous data. 
It is commonly used in data optimization.

In fact, it forms the foundation of a project recently sold for 2 million dollars that helps the electricity distribution company, 
previously known as "TEDAÅž", to approximately determine the amount of electricity consumption needed for the next day. I had the opportunity to review a part of it.

Here, I examined how the result of a simple equation can be obtained using these types of interpolation methods and which one provides the most accurate result. 
There are many solution methods available.
